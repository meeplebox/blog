So this is public now? Scary. This brainchild of ours that was bound to happen sooner or later but never actually did, now it has all thanks to a selected few beers (well...).

### Name of the game

After some debate it has been settled for which game that will be implemented first. The choice is **Hearts**. A good choice as it is well known, in the public domain and got an easy set of rules. At this point in time we have tons of other things to implement so the actual game is best to be kept a tiny obstacle at the moment. Game lobby, game management, registration, sign ins and what nots is all but trivial and is going to need full attention for quite some time. The game itself is lending itself nicely to our plan that among other things contains rule templating, game state machines and the asset library. I hope to be able to give an overview of these particular three in a couple of weeks time since I think those are going to fairly well describe what we are trying to accomplish with this project.

### Meteor

Oh well, I better be get going and cram my head full of Javascript and Meteor code. More about Meteor next week as I would guess that this is what is going to attract any interest at this early point. Meteor, for those that either aren't developers or developers dwelling under some rock, is a awesome platform to produle web and mobile apps in pure Javascript. Have a look at their [site](http://meteor.com/), it's well worth a look. Beware though. It might render you a new sparetime filler.
