Meeplebox aims to provide a platform for boardgames and cardgames to be played online on your computer, tablet and/or phone. Our hope is to provide game settings appealing to both casual players as well has hardcore grognards. We hope o deliver a platform that is going to enable designers to use Meeplebox as a tool to design and test their games, delivering a game sandbox that is usable without the need to write any code.

## Play formats

* Real time
* Turn based ranging from near real time to weekly
* Single games
* Tournaments

## Status of the project

Meeplebox are currently in an very early plannng stage. Some initial coding have been done but there is as of yet no public plan as to when we will be able to invite gamers, designers and others that might have an interest in the project. Watch this space for future updates.

* January 2015 - Planning, architectual decisions and some coding for key elements that need early proof of concept
